My personal dotfiles

## Setup

Setup is mostly scripted as `./setup.sh`, but there are some manual steps still

### 1. Run the script

```sh
$ ./setup.sh
```

### 2. Install vim plugins

Open vim, and run `:PluginInstall`.  You use [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) to manage your vim plugins.
